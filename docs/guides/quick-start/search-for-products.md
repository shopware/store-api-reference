# Searching for products

## Overview

One of the customers' most common actions in an online store is browsing products. In this section, you will learn how to:

* Search products
* Filter and sort products
* Apply field projections \(make the response smaller\)
* Work with associations

## Simple search

Let us start by performing a simple product search.

**Try it out**

```json http
{
  "method": "post",
  "url": "http://localhost/store-api/search",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Accept": "application/json",
    "sw-access-key": "SWSCDZH3WULKMDGXTMNQS2VRVG"
  },
  "body": {
    "search": "abc"
  }
}
```

```javascript
// POST /store-api/search

{
    "search": "braeburn"
}
```

Have a look at the response:

```javascript
{
  "sorting": "score",
  "currentFilters": {
    "manufacturer": [],
    "price": {
      "min": null,
      "max": null
    },
    "rating": null,
    "shipping-free": false,
    "properties": [],
    "search": "braeburn"
  },
  "page": 1,
  "limit": 24,
  "availableSortings": [
    {
      "key": "name-asc",
      "label": "Name A-Z",
      "id": "2526e30bf667446a888d04804483939b",
      "apiAlias": "product_sorting"
    },
    {
      "key": "name-desc",
      "label": "Name Z-A",
      "id": "3757223aef334b61a41c7d1b07fad8f1",
      "apiAlias": "product_sorting"
    },
    {
      "key": "price-asc",
      "label": "Price ascending",
      "id": "05d09bfc26c6468ca2ede06e0f8ebf52",
      "apiAlias": "product_sorting"
    },
    {
      "key": "price-desc",
      "label": "Price descending",
      "id": "79db02f2acf644178c0fae80434d95cd",
      "apiAlias": "product_sorting"
    },
    {
      "key": "score",
      "label": "Top results",
      "id": "12be6eee109444b39e15bf014bf8e928",
      "apiAlias": "product_sorting"
    },
    {
      "key": "topseller",
      "label": "Topseller",
      "id": "acbde485a5fd429c94dada82260c465a",
      "apiAlias": "product_sorting"
    }
  ],
  "total": 1,
  "aggregations": {
    "manufacturer": {
      "entities": [ ... ],
      "apiAlias": "manufacturer_aggregation"
    },
    "price": {
      "min": "149",
      "max": "149",
      "avg": null,
      "sum": null,
      "apiAlias": "price_aggregation"
    },
    "rating": {
      "max": 0,
      "apiAlias": "rating_aggregation"
    },
    "shipping-free": {
      "max": 0,
      "apiAlias": "shipping-free_aggregation"
    },
    "properties": { ... },
    "options": { ... }
  },
  "elements": [
    {
      "translated": {
        "name": "Box Braeburn Apples (2 kg)",
      },
      "id": "eaf1ee42ef884f3c941f22596aa0163f",
      "apiAlias": "product"
    }
  ],
  "apiAlias": "product_listing"
}
```

The response has the `ProductListingResult` type. Often, responses are some type of listings, such as products, categories, or orders. These usually have the type `EntitySearchResult`. As you can see below, the `ProductListingResult` contains some additional fields which help build listing interactions.

```json json_schema
{
  "$ref": "../../../storeapi.json#/components/schemas/ProductListingResult"
}
```

## Refined search

You can apply any of the given sortings by passing them through the `order` field.

**Try it out**

```json http
{
  "method": "post",
  "url": "http://localhost/store-api/search",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Accept": "application/json",
    "sw-access-key": "SWSCDZH3WULKMDGXTMNQS2VRVG"
  },
  "body": {
    "search": "abc",
    "order": "topseller"
  }
}
```

```javascript
// POST /store-api/search

{
    "search": "braeburn",
    "order": "topseller"
}
```

Let us say you want to filter out products with a price higher than 50.00. We simply add a `filter` section and apply a `range` filter for the price field. Note that `filter` is an array, and you can pass in multiple filters at once.

**Try it out**

```json http
{
  "method": "post",
  "url": "http://localhost/store-api/search",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Accept": "application/json",
    "sw-access-key": "SWSCDZH3WULKMDGXTMNQS2VRVG"
  },
  "body": {
    "search": "abc",
    "order": "topseller",
    "filter": [
      {
        "type": "range",
        "field": "stock",
        "parameters": {
          "lt": 50
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

```javascript
// POST /store-api/search

{
    "search": "braeburn",
    "order": "topseller",
    "filter": [
        {
            "type": "range",
            "field": "stock",
            "parameters": {
                "lt": 50.0
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

## Product listing criteria

Several endpoints accept additional search and filtering parameters wrapped in a specification called as product listing criteria. Most of these parameters are shorthands which could also be written using the search criteria specifications. Some others add logic that is not supported by the search criteria, such as filtering by prices.

Endpoints supporting this specification are:

 * /store-api/search
 * /store-api/product-listing/{categoryId}

All parameters are **optional** and can be passed within the request body.

```json json_schema
{
  "type": "object",
  "description": "Additional search parameters for product listings",
  "properties": {
    "order": {
      "description": "Specifies the sorting of the products by `availableSortings`. If not set, the default sorting will be set according to the shop settings. The available sorting options are sent within the response under the `availableSortings` key. In order to sort by a field, consider using the `sort` parameter from the listing criteria. Do not use both parameters together, as it might lead to unexpected results.",

      "nullable": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Field projection

A single-product response from the search endpoint already measures ~11KB. That is because many fields from the product are loaded eagerly. However, you can restrict the response to only the fields you need.

Take a look at the search response from above. Most of the objects contain a `apiAlias` key. You can use this key to refer to a list of fields you want to include in your response.

The following request provides us with a response containing the most essential fields we need to display a simple product listing that only measures ~2.5KB for a single-product listing.

**Try it out**

```json http
{
  "method": "post",
  "url": "http://localhost/store-api/search",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Accept": "application/json",
    "sw-access-key": "SWSCDZH3WULKMDGXTMNQS2VRVG"
  },
  "body": {
    "search": "abc",
    "includes": {
      "product_sorting": ["id", "translated"],
      "product_manufacturer": ["id", "translated"],
      "product": ["id", "name", "translated", "cover", "calculatedPrice"],
      "property_group": ["id", "name", "translated", "options"],
      "property_group_option": ["id", "name", "translated"],
      "calculated_price": ["totalPrice", "listPrice"],
      "product_media": ["media"],
      "media": ["thumbnails"],
      "media_thumbnail": ["width", "height", "url"]
    }
  }
}
```

```javascript
// POST /store-api/search

{
    "search": "breaburn",
    "includes": {
      "product_sorting": ["id", "translated"],
      "product_manufacturer": ["id", "translated"],
      "product": ["id", "name", "translated", "cover", "calculatedPrice"],
      "property_group": ["id", "name", "translated", "options"],
      "property_group_option": ["id", "name", "translated"],
      "calculated_price": ["totalPrice", "listPrice"],
      "product_media": ["media"],
      "media": ["thumbnails"],
      "media_thumbnail": ["width", "height", "url"]
    }
  }
```

It does not take much time to shrink your response down to a fraction, and you have full control over the fields it contains.

> Why is the **`translated`** field always included?
> 
> Most natural text fields in Shopware are stored as translatable values. Depending on the current language, Shopware will try to hydrate these fields with the correct value. At times, text value is not maintained in a given language. In such cases, Shopware provides a fallback mechanism based on a translation hierarchy. However, these fallback values are only contained in the translated field of the entity.
>
> By using **`product.translated.name`** instead of **`product.name`**, you can always fallback correctly when there is no translated value present.

## Fetching associations

Sometimes it is necessary to fetch additional associations like categories or properties of a product. We can specify those additional associations using a corresponding field within the request body. All fields used in the example below are parts of the [Search Criteria](../../concepts/search-queries.md).

**Try it out**

```json http
{
  "method": "post",
  "url": "http://localhost/store-api/search",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Accept": "application/json",
    "sw-access-key": "SWSCDZH3WULKMDGXTMNQS2VRVG"
  },
  "body": {
    "search": "abc",
    "associations": {
      "categories": {}
    },
    "includes": {
      "product_listing": ["elements"],
      "product": ["id", "name", "translated", "categories"],
      "category": ["id", "name", "translated"]
    }
  }
}
```

```javascript
// POST /store-api/search

{
    "search": "braeburn",
    "associations": {
        "categories": {}
    },
    "includes": {
        "product_listing": ["elements"],
        "product": ["id", "translated", "categories"],
        "category": ["id", "translated"]
    }
}
```

Once you have provided the association, Shopware will try to fetch the related entities and hydrate the response accordingly.

> **Wonder which associations they are?**
>
> Normally, an unfiltered response already suggests which associations you could load. Usually, these fields are pre-filled with `null` if the association is not fetched. You can always look into the corresponding entity schema given in our reference.
>
> Have a look at the [product schema](./c2NoOjE1MDg3ODI3-product)

## Fetch a single product

Sometimes, you just want to fetch a single product. The product endpoint lets you do this.

**Try it out**

```json http
{
  "method": "post",
  "url": "http://localhost/store-api/product/b728db0e3fd04947ae2f8a79d72d1f26",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Accept": "application/json",
    "sw-access-key": "SWSCDZH3WULKMDGXTMNQS2VRVG"
  }
}
```

```text
// POST /store-api/product/eaf1ee42ef884f3c941f22596aa0163f
```

Now that you are done with searching for products, let us do something more.
